# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, and I'm excited to introduce myself to you! I'm a Final year Uni student in HKUST with a passion for creating fun and innovative projects.

## What I'm Working On
Lately, I've been working on a few different projects that you'll find interesting. Here are just a few:

 **[Video Promotion Research in China Universities]**: For this project, I wanted to challenge myself to use automation and analytical skills to fulfil the research requirement at my work. It's been a lot of work, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished.

## What I Can Bring to the Table
I'm excited about possibly working with you because I know that my skills and experience would be a great fit for your team. Here are just a few things that I can bring to the table:

Creativity: I love coming up with new and innovative ideas, and I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.

Problem-Solving Skills: Whether it's troubleshooting a tricky bug or figuring out how to implement a new feature, I'm always up for a challenge.

Collaboration: I work well with others, and I'm always looking for ways to support and encourage my teammates.
